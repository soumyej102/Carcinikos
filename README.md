# Lung and Prostate Cancer Detector


### Problem : 
Prostate Gland Cancer is the second leading cancer in men and the numbers have doubled in the last decade.
Lung cancer is the most often diagnosed cancer and leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. This project aims to help in the early diagnosis of lung cancer and prostate gland cancer in men.

### Solution:

This Web app will help you to detect the presence of Prostate Cancer in an individual features using the Random Forest Classifier. This aspect of the project uses a non image dataset. /n
We have used a modified CNN with multiple layers and custom Activation functions for detecting the presence of lung cancer. An image dataset with MRI scans for the same.

### Idea: 
Building an application that can help in the early diagnosis of lung cancer and prostate gland cancer in men.

### Data:
The data folder only contains a part of images used. Please do keep the same in mind before proposing any changes justified by the accuracy of your proposed model using these images.
